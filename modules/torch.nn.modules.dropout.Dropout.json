According to the reference implementation in torch._refs.nn.functional.dropout() at line 201-202, when not training, the function simply returns the input tensor directly without any computation or data movement. This is a Python reference return - no tensor data is copied, no arithmetic is performed, and no memory is accessed. The dropout probability p and scaling factor 1/(1-p) are only applied during training to regularize the network. During inference, dropout is completely transparent with zero cost, as the expected value correction was already applied during training.",
